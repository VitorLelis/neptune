# Neptune 

Neptune is a mobile app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) that serves as a swimming team manager. It allows coaches and team managers to register swimmer information and times, form the best relay teams, rank swimmers by event, and convert times across courses.
